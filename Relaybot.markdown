title: Ignoring RelayBot
permalink: /Relaybot.html
---

RelayBot is the bot which relays between #supybot at freenode and oftc. It
is currently using the [LinkRelay](https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-plugins/tree/master/LinkRelay)Â plugin to do this.

It's sometimes considered as annoyance as it has lately mostly spammed
with join (part messages aren't working, because of a bug (2014-06-23))
messages of people who usually say nothing and this is why this page is
here to tell how to ignore it on various client.

We encourage you to ignore only notices from RelayBot instead of
everything as there are people whom should be heard at OFTC (mainly main
Supybot developer).

Hostmask of RelayBot on 2014-06-23:

* RelayBot!progval@pdpc/supporter/student/progval
    * This is absolute hostmask
* RelayBot*!*@pdpc/supporter/student/progval
    * This is recommended hostmask as it matches RelayBot even if it 
    cannot use it's primary nickname or networks cannot connect to it's 
    identd.

## HexChat

From the "Window" menu you can find "Ignore list". Click "Add" and add 
one of the hostmasks mentioned above (the lower is recommended).

Uncheck the other checkboxes than "Notice" and you can close the window 
and you won't see spamming.

## KVIRC

I am not primarily KVIRC user and I cannot say anything else than right 
click RelayBot and select something that matches only RelayBot.

**WARNING: KVIRC makes it very easy to also ignore pinkieval which you 
don't want to do as they are author of Limnoria and help people often!**

## Linkinus

According to another person, there is a GUI where you can easily ignore 
notices from specific hostmask.

## WeeChat

```
/filter add relaybotnotices * irc_notice+nick_RelayBot *
```

This creates a new filter with the name "relaybotnotices" which filters 
all notices from the nickname "RelayBot".

This page is very likely missing many IRC clients. Could you
[open an issue](https://github.com/mkaysi/limnoria/issues) 
about how to do this with your IRC client that isn't mentioned here?
