<p>RelayBot is the bot which relays between #supybot at freenode and oftc. It is currently using the <a href="https://github.com/ProgVal/Supybot-plugins/tree/master/LinkRelay">LinkRelay</a>Â plugin to do this.</p>
<p>It's sometimes considered as annoyance as it has lately mostly spammed with join (part messages aren't working, because of a bug (2014-06-23)) messages of people who usually say nothing and this is why this page is here to tell how to ignore it on various client.</p>
<p>We encourage you to ignore only notices from RelayBot instead of everything as there are people whom should be heard at OFTC (mainly main Supybot developer).</p>

<p>Hostmask of RelayBot on 2014-06-23:</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>RelayBot!progval@pdpc/supporter/student/progval
<ul class="incremental">
<li>This is absolute hostmask</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RelayBot<em>!</em><span class="citation">@pdpc/supporter/student/progval</span>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>This is recommended hostmask as it matches RelayBot even if it cannot use it's primary nickname or networks cannot connect to it's identd.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From the &quot;Window&quot; menu you can find &quot;Ignore list&quot;. Click &quot;Add&quot; and add one of the hostmasks mentioned above (the lower is recommended).</p>
<p>Uncheck the other checkboxes than &quot;Notice&quot; and you can close the window and you won't see spamming.</p>
<h2 id="linkinus">Linkinus</h2>
<p>According to another person, there is a GUI where you can easily ignore notices from specific hostmask.</p>
<h2 id="weechat">WeeChat</h2>
<pre><code>/filter add relaybotnotices * irc_notice+nick_RelayBot *</code></pre>
<p>This creates a new filter with the name &quot;relaybotnotices&quot; which filters all notices from the nickname &quot;RelayBot&quot;.</p>
<hr/>

<p>This page is very likely missing many IRC clients. Could you <a href="https://github.com/mkaysi/limnoria/issues">open issues</a> about how to do this with IRC clients that aren't mentioned here?</p>
