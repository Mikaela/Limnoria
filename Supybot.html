<h2 id="latest-version-of-supybot-was-released-in-2009">Latest version of Supybot was released in 2009</h2>
<p>All activity happens in git repository of Supybot nowadays and it happens seldomly. The version, which was released in 2009 is 0.83.4.1.</p>
<p>It's available from <a href="http://supybot.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>, Debian repositories, Ubuntu repositories and repositories of many other Linux distributions.</p>
<h2 id="has-critical-issues">0.83.4.1 has critical issues</h2>
<p>What issues?</p>
<h3 id="anyone-can-crash-it-and-computer-where-its-running-on">1. Anyone can crash it and computer where it's running on</h3>
<p>And this is very easy. Just run the command</p>
<pre><code>!misc last --regexp m/(.*\w){512}/</code></pre>
<p>where ! is the prefix character.</p>
<p>Misc is loaded by default and cannot be unloaded without modifying the config.</p>
<h3 id="the-previous-wasnt-the-only-way-to-do-this">2. The previous wasn't the only way to do this</h3>
<p>Everyone can also make the bot count an equation, which brings it and the host computer down.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>!math calc factorial(999999)</code></pre>
<h3 id="anyone-can-access-network-services-via-the-bot.">3. Anyone can access network services via the bot.</h3>
<p>I don't have example command for this, but it happens by nesting &quot;format cut&quot; and &quot;misc tell&quot;.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Anyone can tell the bot to ghost someone else on same account, take over a channel by telling the bot to give flags (if it has correct flags), change password of the account and everything else what you do with network services.</p>
<h3 id="web-page-with-special-characters-in-title-can-be-used-to-send-dccctcp-commands.">4. Web page with special characters in title can be used to send DCC/CTCP commands.</h3>
<p>This doesn't mean only things like CTCP actions (also known as /me), but known problems with old routers ( FF ? DCC SEND “ff???f??????????????” 0 0 0 ) which make them reconnect to the internet.</p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>!web title &lt;malicious.page.here&gt;
!web fetch &lt;malicious.page.here&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Note that web fetch is disabled by default.</p>
<h1 id="are-these-issues-publicly-known">Are these issues publicly known?</h1>
<p><STRONG>Of course they are.</strong> They have been reported to</p>

</ol>
<p>The first issue has been also used to take down some of <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/Bots">Ubuntu IRC bots</a> several times. At least UbotX (I don't remember the number) and meetingology.</p>

<li>to their IRC channel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of them are fixed in git repository, but most people aren't using it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-avoid-them">How to avoid them?</h2>
<p>You can add anticapability for these commands using &quot;owner defaultcapability&quot;, but that is only a temporary solution. There can also be other issues.</p>
<p>There are also two active Supybot forks, known as <a href="https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria">Limnoria</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gribble/index.php?title=Main_Page">Gribble</a>, which are actively developed and have fixed these issues. If you want permanent solution, you should install either of them.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria">Limnoria</a>, because it seems to be more active (activity of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gribble/index.php?title=Main_Page">Gribble</a> isn't announced anywhere) and it has additional commands, translations and new plugin called <a href="https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/tree/master/plugins/PluginDownloader">PluginDownloader</a>, which makes installing of 3rd party plugins easy. Ohloh supports comparing different projescts, <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/compare?project_0=Limnoria&amp;project_1=Gribble%3A+Support+Bottie&amp;project_2=Supybot">here is comparsion of Limnoria, Gribble and Supybot</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you use Debian/Ubuntu or any Debian based distribution, you can get <a href="http://builds.progval.net/limnoria/limnoria-master-HEAD.deb">stable version of Limnoria here</a> or <a href="http://builds.progval.net/limnoria/limnoria-testing-HEAD.deb">testing version here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The links above should always be the latest version of Limnoria and they are updated daily.</p>

<h2 id="installing-forks">Installing forks</h2>
<h3 id="for-all-of-them.">For all of them.</h3>
<p>You should install [pip] (usually python-pip in repositories) and [git].</p>
<p>Windows users should also install [pip] and [msysgit] and in [msysgit] select to run <strong>unix tools in PATH</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: pip is included with Python =&lt; 3.4! Python 3 is only supported by Limnoria.</p>
<p>For <strong>rootless installation and upgrading</strong>, please see <a href="http://supybot.aperio.fr/doc/use/install.html#local-installation">Limnoria's documentation.</a> which you should be able to modify to install stock Supybot or gribble with the information below.</p>
<p>If you don't have sudo, please simply remove it from beginnings of lines and run the commands as root or Administrator.</p>
<p>[pip]: [msysgit]:</p>
<h3 id="supybot">Supybot</h3>
<p><strong>Not recommended as it's not actively developed.</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install git+https://github.com/supybot/supybot.git</code></pre>
<h3 id="gribble">gribble</h3>
<p>Less actively developed than Limnoria and doesn't support Python 3.</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install git+https://github.com/nanotube/supybot_fixes.git</code></pre>
<h3 id="limnoria">Limnoria</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, the most active Supybot fork which includes embedded HTTPd for plugins needing it, supports other languages than English and also runs with Python 3.</p>
<p>The first command installs requirements of Limnoria and the second Limnoria itself. Only Limnoria has requirements.txt file at the moment.</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProgVal/Limnoria/master/requirements.txt
sudo pip install git+https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria.git@master</code></pre>
